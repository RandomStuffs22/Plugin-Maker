<b>Plugin Maker</b> is a stunning new web application to help you building up <a href="http://www.mybb.com">MyBB</a> plugins.
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
Plugin Maker guides you into building the main structure of MyBB plugins. You have full control over your custom plugin: you decide whatever you want to add or remove. These are some things Plugin Maker lets you add to your plugins:
<ul>
	<li>PluginLibrary support;</li>
	<li>settings;</li>
	<li>templates;</li>
	<li>stylesheets;</li>
	<li>core edits<sup>1</sup>;</li>
	<li>template edits;</li>
	<li>ACP modules;</li>
	<li>language files;</li>
	<li>other functions;</li>
	<li>and much more!</li>
</ul>
Also, it has a solid database of MyBB hooks, ordered by board's components (homepage, posts, threads, forums, etc.) so you can easily decide where to inject your custom code.
<h2>Examples, please?</h2>
Imagine you want to create, let's say, a "latest threads" box in your Homepage. You might start creating a new file in DreamWeaver and start writing down the entire plugin yourself. Or you might open Plugin Maker, add two basic settings, add some templates, select the index_end hook from the Homepage hooks list and write down the function which returns the latest threads. You finally click a button and you download your plugin. What fun!
This is exactly what Plugin Maker does: speeding up the development process by automatically handling all the boring structuring part and building up the plugin with an easy to understand interface.
<h2>This is for beginners...</h2>
Not at all. Plugin Maker was designed both for beginners with few coding skills to help them moving their first steps in MyBB's world, and for advanced coders with solid PHP and MyBB knowledges helping them speeding up <b>at least</b> the initial setup of the plugin structure.
I was kinda bored having to copy&paste language files, templates, etc. and edit them for new plugins, thus why I've made this helpful wizard for me and for everybody else who wants to code quickly and having fun while you code. You still think this app is for n00bs? Don't use it and keep on developing the way you're used.
